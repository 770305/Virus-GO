# Virus-GO
README of VG101 Project

## Background
This is the readme for our VG101 project. We are group 9. And we create a game using C++ named Virus GO. 
In this game, you perform as a virus which invade our bady. You should fight with emenies-immune cells, find props to promote your properties. You should also search landmarks then you can pass through the map which we design. This game is just like the typical game-magic Tower. We design three layers for our game. 

## Install

You can use this link to download the zip and use Clion to compile and configure the game.

## Use
Run the game,then you can see that you have four properties-ATK, DEF,HP and Level. Type "start" on the command line, then you can see the map. In this map, you are "*". You can use "W","s","a","d" to control "up","down","left","right". "#" means wall which you can not pass through. "A" means ATK+2, "D" means DEF+2, "H" means HP+200. Numbers mean different kinds of enenies, they have different properties, you can choose whether to attack them. After you beat the enemy, you can get experiences, you can upgrade one level after you get 100 experiences. "Y" means yellow door, "R" means red door, "B" means blue door. Corresponding to it, "y" means yellow key, "r" means red key, "b" means blue key. Only you have the right color key, you can open the door. We have three layers of map, you can go to the "+" to up the layers, you can also go to the "-" to down the layers. After you go through all these three maps, then you win.
For this game, please find the best way to pass and enjoy it!
