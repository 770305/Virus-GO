## Background
This is the readme for our VG101 project. We are group 9. And we create a game using C++ named Virus GO. 

In this game, you perform as a virus which invade our bady. You should fight with emenies-immune cells and medical equipment, find props to promote your properties. You should also search landmarks then you can pass through the map which we design. This game is just like the typical game-Magic Tower. We design three layers for our game.

3.In this map, you are the virus.

4.You can use "w","s","a","d" to control "up","down","left","right". 

5.Blue grid means wall which you can not pass through. 

6.Red gem means ATK+2, blue gem means DEF+2, liquid medicine means HP+200.

7.There are different kinds of enenies, they have different properties, you can choose whether to attack them. 

8.After you beat the enemy, you can get experiences, you can upgrade one level after you get 100 experiences. 

9.There are yellow door, red door and blue door. Corresponding to it, there are yellow key, red key, and blue key.

10.Only you have the right color key, you can open the door.

11.We have three layers of map, you can go to the "upstairs" to up the layers, you can also go to the "downstairs" to down the layers. 

12.After you go through all these three maps, then you win.

## For the Fight
You can choose whether to attack the enemy. You can attack first. In a round, your ATK minuses the emeny's DEF is the damage you make the emeny. It is the same when the enemy attack you. Only your ATK is bigger than the enemy's DEF,then you can attack the enemy.
